# Optimization-Techniques

This project was created for academic purposes on the subject of 'Optimization Techniques' at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

The unconstrained optimization methods implemented are:
* Steepest Descent Method
* Newton's Method

Algorithm that computes the criteria concerning optimal conditions for unconstrained optimization problems is also implemented.
